# 🛠️ HelpProject

**Because remembering payloads is harder than finding the vuln.**

## What is this?

**HelpProject** is my personal assistant for cybersecurity commands, payloads, and reminders.  
It’s a tool I’m building to automate the stuff I’ve learned — or more honestly, the stuff I keep forgetting — like:

- XXE payloads
- XSS tricks
- SQLi tests
- `curl` setups
- VHost enumeration
- ... and whatever else pops up during CTFs, labs, or pentests

## Why?

Because my brain has limited RAM, and Stack Overflow isn't always there in the heat of the moment.  
HelpProject helps me:

- Run frequently used commands faster
- Review techniques without digging through old notes
- Avoid reinventing the wheel for the 87th time

## What it does (so far)

The tool is still in progress
